# What was done this week?
- Completed Users controller.
- Now a user can request the password reset through two different endpoints.
First endpoint sends an email with the reset link, this link then navigates to password reset page
where she/he needs to put a new password and repeat it, later we are sending the request back to API.
- Added password hashing using BCRYPT algorithm.
- Added HTML templates for success/failure when changing the password.
- Added HTML page for changing the password.
- Refactored Users controller.
- Improved swagger documentation.
- Refactored email helpers class.
- Other small improvements.

# What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
- We're having troubles with workload distribution.

# What is the goal for next week?
- Either to start working on authentication via OAuth or JWT or start working on Admin/Images controller.

# What is the overall status?
Yellow.
