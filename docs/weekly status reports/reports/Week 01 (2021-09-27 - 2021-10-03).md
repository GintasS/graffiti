# What was done this week?
- Refactored requirements spec as per received comments.
- Added API endpoints for all the controllers.
- Added constants.
- Added SQLite dabatase integration.
- Added request/response and entity mappings.
- Refactored Swagger documentation with request/response classes, HTTP status codes.

# What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
- Currently, none.

# What is the goal for next week?
- Integrate more API endpoints with the database. The best-case scenario would be to have all controllers ready,
but at least two controllers should be ready after the next week.

# What is the overall status?
Yellow.
