# What was done this week?

- Refactored whole project
- Added validation for DB entities and marshmallow models
- Worked on TODO comments, categorised new tasks
- Immense progress on the project report

# What issues/risks/blockers do you have?

- The program works on localhost, so we're having big compactibility issues between Windows and Unix systems, thus limiting how many people can work on actual code.

# What is the goal for next week?

- Remove stale items from the GitLab (issues, branches)
- Finish the database management systems mini project
- Work on automating the virtualization task

# What is the overall status?

- Yellow
