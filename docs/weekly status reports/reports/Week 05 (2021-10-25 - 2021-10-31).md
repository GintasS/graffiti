# What was done this week?

- Added image deletion
- Added location helper
- Added helper to convert coordinates to decimal degrees
- Added geography-related python libraries
- Updated image library
- Image comparison research and documentation

# What issues/risks/blockers do you have?

- The program works on localhost, so we're having big compactibility issues between Windows and Unix systems, thus limiting how many people can work on actual code.

# What is the goal for next week?

- Improve the Git repository (currently we have files that aren't supposed to be there)
- Stop using localhost
- Smaller bugfixes

# What is the overall status?

- Yellow

<!-- 
  Green - everything is normal, we are not falling the plan.
  Yellow - we have blockers, we are taking longer than expected, we are falling behind the plan.
  Red - situation is critical, people are not working, we are completing our work, we are very behind the plan.
