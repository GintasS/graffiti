- Added image deletion
- Added location helper
- Added helper to convert coordinates to decimal degrees
- Added geography-related python libraries
- Updated image library
- Image comparison research and documentation

# What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
- The program works on localhost, so we're having big compactibility issues between Windows and Unix systems, thus limiting how many people can work on actual code.

# What is the goal for next week?
- Improve the Git repository (currently we have files that aren't supposed to be there)
- Stop using localhost
- Smaller bugfixes

# What is the overall status?
- Yellow
