# Feature Request

**Describe the Request**

<!-- Insert date in the parentheses. -->
We need to post our weekly accomplishments for Software Engineering by the next Tuesday ().

**Describe Preferred Solution**

First week's example:
```
# What was done this week?
- Refactored requirements spec as per received comments.
- Added API endpoints for all the controllers.
- Added constants.
- Added SQLite dabatase integration.
- Added request/response and entity mappings.
- Refactored Swagger documentation with request/response classes, HTTP status codes.


# What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
- Currently, none.


# What is the goal for next week?
- Integrate more API endpoints with database. Best-case scenario would be to have all controllers ready, 
but at least two controllers should be ready after the next week.


# What is the overall status?
Yellow.


<!-- 
  Green - everything is normal, we are not falling the plan.
  Yellow - we have blockers, we are taking longer than expected, we are falling behind the plan.
  Red - situation is critical, people are not working, we are completing our work, we are very behind the plan.
