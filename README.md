<p>GraffLib is a comprehensive application designed to catalog and explore graffiti art across urban environments. It serves as a temporal gallery and a tool for searching similar graffiti. With a combination of graffiti and library functionalities, GraffLib aims to capture the beauty and dynamics of graffiti in cities.

GraffLib offers a powerful Android application that allows users to interact with the platform on the go. The Android app provides a user-friendly interface to catalog, explore, and search for graffiti art. Users can take photos of graffiti, upload them to the platform, and mark their locations on the map. The app also supports viewing the temporal gallery, allowing users to see how graffiti spots evolve over time. Additionally, users can manage their profiles, view their contributions, and interact with other graffiti enthusiasts through the app.

The Restful API is a core component of GraffLib, enabling seamless integration with various platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop applications. The API provides endpoints for all major functionalities, such as graffiti cataloging, image uploads, and geographic data handling.
