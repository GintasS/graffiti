**GraffLib** is a comprehensive application designed to catalog and explore graffiti art across urban environments. It serves as a temporal gallery and a tool for searching similar graffiti. With a combination of graffiti and library functionalities, GraffLib aims to capture the beauty and dynamics of graffiti in cities.
